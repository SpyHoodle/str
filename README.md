# Str - A smart storage organisational system

## Rules
Some rules apply for storing items:
- Every str area i.e. (1.2.1) must be a physical container (i.e. a box)
- 1.1.0 is another way of saying "all the items that are in 1.1"
- The root (str area 0) can be reserved for anything you like that is an edge case scenario
  - However it is recommended to reserve this for your person

## How do we use str?
- For adding something to the system: `str add [area] [item] [type]`
  - E.g. `str add 2.1 Nintendo DS +charging cable`
